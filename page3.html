      <td>Hidden is a novel, riveting, suspenseful, and exciting, a real page-turner. It's a saga that takes us through a decade
        of brutal war and fragile peace; that brings us from wartime Germany to the DP camps, post-war America and embattled
        Palestine; that introduces us to many unforgettable characters, some evil, some righteous, many flawed but searching.
        But more: though the story is fictional, it holds many truths the truths of Jewish survival, faith and destiny.</td>
